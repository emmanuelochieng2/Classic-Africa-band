    <p>The Bongo music scene is, without doubt, a ground swarming with talent. The industry has seen the rise of several youngsters who go on to dominate the entire East African musical scene. With this high talent quotient in mind, it is reasonable for anyone to conclude that no rise has been as remarkable as the rise of the Yamoto Band. Having started out in the Mkubwa Na Wanawe outfit, the group of four went on to rename their band after their first hit song , Ya Moto. Their entry was almost dramatic and extremely trendy coupled with a back to back release of hit songs
        <h1>Band Members</h1>
        <h2>Dogo Aslay</h2>

        <p>Arguably this is the band's backbone, and his real name is Siaka Nasor. Dogo Aslay had made a reputation for himself even before he joined the Mkubwa Na Wanawe Band that later became the Yamoto Band. He did some of the best hits of the band including Naenda Kusema Kwa Mama<

    <h2>Maromboso</h2>

    <p>Mbwana Yusuph Kilungi aka Maromboso is the other prominent member of the Yamoto Band. His style and sense of fashion undoubtedly contributed to the popularity of Yamoto Band. He was specifically against reckless leaks of music online before the official release. With the band taking a cooling, he has been associated with Diamond Platinumz’ record label WCB. Maromboso has denied the allegations, but analysts say his close association with Diamond, one of the kings of Bongo music, could be up to something and it is only a matter </p>

    <h2>Enock Bella</h2>

    <p>Enock had one distinct voice in the band, making him a unique feature. The voice became a common feature of Yamoto Band’s songs especially as they were hitting a climax. He too like other Yamoto Band members, is now working on his solo releases

    <h2>Beka</h2>
    <img class="image5" src=https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs612tbe0kn5f.jpg?im width=900 alt="Beka">
    <p>When rumors of Yamoto Band’s impending collapse were rife on the internet, it was Beka who first publicly expressed his displeasure with Aslay. Beka was of the opinion that Aslay had gone ahead with a release of his single without proper consultation. Some of his opinions left little doubt that all was not well in Tanzania’s fastest growing music band>
